# Getting started

---

Before you start, you should familiarize yourself with the original [Animated API](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated.html) to understand how animations are done in `Animated` since `Reanimated` is based on it (Fun fact: Reanimated is also backwards compatible with the `Animated API` ğŸ™Œ).

NOTE: Throughout this document when we refer to classes or methods prefixed with `Animated`: we are referring to them being imported from `react-native-reanimated` package instead of plain `react-native`, unless stated otherwise.

## Installation

I. Install the library from NPM repository:

```bash
  yarn add react-native-reanimated
```

II. Link native code with `react-native` CLI:

```bash
  react-native link react-native-reanimated
```

III. When you want to use "reanimated" in your project, import it from the `react-native-reanimated` package:

```js
import Animated from 'react-native-reanimated';
```

e.g. when you need `Easing` import it from the `react-native-reanimated` package instead of `react-native`:

```js
import Animated, { Easing } from 'react-native-reanimated';
```

## Testing

In order to use `react-native-reanimated` with Jest, you need to add the following mock implementation at the top of your test:

```js
jest.mock('react-native-reanimated', () =>
  require('react-native-reanimated/mock')
);
```
